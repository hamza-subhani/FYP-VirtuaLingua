VirtuaLingua
In VirtuaLingua, we integrate Task Based Language Teaching (TBLT) in a Virtual Reality (VR) environment to create a more immersive and engaging language learning experience for people. The VR environment will be designed to simulate an airport environment, where avatars will respond to questions. People will be able to interact with the avatars to practice their speaking and listening skills in the English language. The VR environment will also be used to create different tasks for people, such as asking for directions or checking in for a flight. This project will explore the potential of VR to improve language learning outcomes and provide a more realistic and engaging learning experience for people.
